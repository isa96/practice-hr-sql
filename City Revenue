A number of cities each have a number of agencies that estimate revenues. The average revenue of a city is defined as the average of all agencies' estimates of revenue for a city.

 

Write a query to print the floor of the average revenue of each city. The order of output does not matter. The result should be in the following format: CITY_NAME AVERAGE_REVENUE

 

Schema
There are 2 tables: CITIES, and REVENUE.

CITIES
Name	Type	Description
CITY_CODE	INTEGER	The city's PINCODE. This is a primary key.
CITY_NAME	STRING	The city's name.
REVENUE
Name	Type	Description
CITY_CODE	INTEGER	The city's PINCODE.
REVENUE	INTEGER	The estimated revenue.
Sample Data Tables
CITIES
CITY_CODE	CITY_NAME
1	New York
2	London
3	Paris
REVENUE
CITY_CODE	REVENUE
1	10
2	5
2	10
3	15
 

Sample Output

New York 10
London 7
Paris 15
Explanation

New York has only one estimate, so it is the average.
London has two estimates.  The average of those is floor((5+9)/2) = 7.
Paris has only one estimate, so it is the average.

//CODE

SELECT DISTINCT cities.city_name, FLOOR(AVG(revenue.revenue)) 
FROM cities
JOIN revenue
ON cities.city_code = revenue.city_code
GROUP BY cities.city_name;
