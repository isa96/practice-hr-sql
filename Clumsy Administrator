Clumsy Administrator
A company maintains the records of all employees. The company pays the database administrator too little so the work has been quite clumsy. The administrator carelessly inserted the records of many employees into the employee records table multiple times. An employee's record is considered duplicate only if all columns (fields) of the employee's record are duplicated.

 

Write a query to find the names of employees whose records occur more than once in the table.

 

Schema
You are provided 1 table: EMPLOYEE.

EMPLOYEE
Name	Type	Description
NAME	STRING	The name of the employee.
PHONE	STRING	The telephone number of the employee.
AGE	INTEGER	The age of the employee.
Sample Data Tables
EMPLOYEE
NAME	PHONE	AGE
Sam	1000040000	30
Alex	1000020000	60
Alex	1000020012	65
Sam	1000040000	30
Chris	1000012000	34
Chris	1000012000	34
 

Here, the exact records of Sam and Chris occur more than once in the table. Hence, Sam and Chris are the employees in the resultant output.

//CODE

SELECT DISTINCT employee.name
FROM employee
GROUP BY employee.name, employee.phone, employee.age
HAVING Count(*) > 1;
