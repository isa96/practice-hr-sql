A university stores students' standardized test scores in a table named STUDENT. Student X placed 213th on the test.

Write a query to find Student X's test score (i.e., the 213th highest STUDENT.SCORE in STUDENT).

Schema
A table is provided: STUDENT.

STUDENT
Name	Type	Description
ID	Integer	The student's unique ID. This is a primary key.
AGE	Integer	The student's age.
SCORE	Integer	The student's standardized test score.
Sample Data Tables
STUDENT
ID	AGE	SCORE
1	19	91
2	20	90
3	20	87
4	21	72
5	19	98
6	20	50
The table's scores (from highest to lowest) are {98, 91, 90, 87, 72, 50}. As an example, the fourth-highest score is 87. For the real query, 
find the 213th highest score.

ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 212, 1
