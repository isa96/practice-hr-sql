Explanation

The students are arranged in the descending order of their math scores, followed by the ascending order of their ids, as shown below:

 

Sid > Tom > Dick > Jerry > Erica > Julia > John > Bob > Harry > Dev

 

Dick's and Jerry's scores were the same, so they are shown in ID order.
/*

Please append a semicolon ";" at the end of the query

// CODE

SELECT id, name
FROM student
ORDER BY student.score DESC, id ASC LIMIT 3;
