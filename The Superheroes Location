The locations of the superheroes have been stored in the SUPERHERO table. Write a query to print the IDs, i.e., SUPERHERO.ID of the superheroes whose latitudes and longitudes both have a value smaller than 50. The order of output does not matter.

 

Input Format

SUPERHERO
Name	Type	Description
ID	Integer	A superhero ID in the inclusive range [1, 1000]. This field is the primary key.

Explanation

For Batman, latitude = 50.23 and longitude = 85.45. So, neither is less than 50. 
For Thor, latitude = 45.34 and longitude = 30.89. So, both are less than 50.
For Deadpool, latitude = 25.12 and longitude = 69.21. So, the latitude is less than 50 but the longitude is greater than 50.
The remaining records are analyzed similarly.
Thor, Hulk, and Doctor Strange have latitudes and longitudes less than 50 so, their IDs are printed.
