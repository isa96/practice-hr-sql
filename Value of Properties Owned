Value of Properties Owned
There are two tables in a database of real estate owners. One has ownership information and the other has price information, in millions. An owner may own multiple houses, but a house will have only one owner.

 

Write a query to print the IDs of the owners who have at least 100 million worth of houses and own more than 1 house. The order of output does not matter. The result should be in the format: BUYER_ID TOTAL_WORTH

 

Schema

BUYER_ID	INTEGER	Unique buyer ID.
HOUSE_ID	STRING	Unique house ID.
